# Portfolio-Optimisation-with-GPLVM

**Abstract**
We propose an integrated framework centered around the Bayesian Gaussian Process Latent Variable model (B-GPLVM) to estimate asset covariance, for deriving optimal hedging strategies to mitigate currency rate in international equity portfolios. We use daily log returns of 12 major international equity indices to construct hedging positions using the mean-variance optimisation framework. The suitability of the B-GPLVM model to fitting the dataset was confirmed by its ability to capture over 97% of variance in the observed data with no more than four latent dimensions, and exhibiting remarkable precision when generating synthetic data. Our approach introduces two novelties, both tailored to the innate characteristics of financial time series data. First, dimensionality is reduced across time to extract latent factors that represent key temporal patterns or events. Second, uncertainty is incorporated by integrating over the posterior distribution over the latent variables when computing the covariance matrix. Back-tests are conducted across years 2019 to 2023 with portfolio rebalancing every 30 days. The results reveal that when fed into the mean-variance optimisation framework, our covariance estimates yield higher Sharpe ratios compared to those obtained using the sample covariance matrix, the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimator, and a Dynamic Factor Model.
